**A simple game made in pygame that is similar to Zelda.**

###Team:

+ Bionca Bond
+ David Kariuki
+ Michael Greene
+ Taylor White

## Conflict Resolution:

+ If two members are unable to resolve their different opinions, the team at large will be asked to vote on the matter. In case of a tie vote or inability to decide, we will ultimately consult Roger as the judge.

## How to Address Inadequate Work:

+ Try to ask the team member to give more input to the project in order to encourage them to contribute, gracefully.
+ Make sure we check in every meeting to ask questions and understand current goals.
+ Understand what responsibilities to the project we have before we start working.

## How to Escalate the Conflict if Your Resolution Attempts are Unsuccessful:

+ All conflicts ultimately will boil down to a majority agreement, however if a consensus cannot be made then Roger will ultimately be the judge.

## Communication:

### Methods of Communication
+ **Trello**
  + Team responsibilities
  + Tasks and Features
  + Current and Long Term Goals
+ **Slack**
  + Quick messaging and doc sharing

## Safe Work Environment:

+ Each team member is guaranteed time to speak on project features uninterrupted.
+ Project time will be treated like a work environment and conduct will be expected as such.
+ All team members are expected to treat others as they expect to be treated.

## Work Plan:

+ Using Trello, each member will be assigned a card with a checklist of tasks so we can expand upon them as we need to and visually inspect progress.

## Git Process:

+ All team members will fork off a main repo, where a ‘dev’ branch will be created for testing and staging, then finally a main branch that will require at least 2 team members' approvals for final merging.
